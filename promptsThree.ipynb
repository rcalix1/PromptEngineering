If the star's mass is greater than approximately three solar masses, the core collapses, and the outer layers are expelled in a supernova explosion, leaving behind a black hole.\n",

    "## Self-Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the more advanced techniques out there for prompt engineering is self-consistency. Proposed by Wang et al. (2022), self-consistency aims \"to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting\". The idea is to sample multiple, diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT, and use the generations to select the most consistent answer. This helps to boost the performance of CoT prompting on tasks involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n"
