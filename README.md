# Prompt Engineering




##  Ilya Sutskever 

* Here are them with examples:

1. Communicate clearly and precisely when writing prompts.

This tip emphasizes the importance of unambiguous language in prompts. Clarity reduces the chance of misinterpretation by the AI model.
Example: Unclear prompt: "Make it better." Clear prompt: "Revise the given text to improve grammar, clarity, and conciseness while maintaining the original meaning."

2. Be willing to iterate rapidly, sending many prompts to the model in quick succession.
This approach allows for quick refinement and improvement of results. It's about not being afraid to try multiple variations quickly.

Example: First attempt: "Write a poem about spring." Refinement: "Write a haiku about cherry blossoms in spring." Further refinement: "Write a haiku about cherry blossoms in spring, emphasizing their ephemeral nature."

3. Consider edge cases and unusual scenarios when designing prompts.
This tip encourages thinking beyond the typical use case to ensure robustness.
Example: Basic prompt: "Calculate the average of these numbers: 5, 10, 15." Edge case consideration: "Calculate the average of these numbers, handling any non-numeric inputs or empty sets: 5, 10, 15, apple, -20, []"

4. Test your prompts with imperfect, realistic user inputs.
This ensures your prompts can handle real-world scenarios where users might not provide perfect input.

Example: Ideal input: "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to French." Realistic input: "tranlate to french: hello how r u"

5. Read and analyze model outputs carefully.
This involves critically examining whether the model's response aligns with the intended outcome.
Example: Prompt: "List 5 capital cities in Europe." Output analysis: Check if all listed cities are indeed capital cities and located in Europe.

6. Strip away assumptions and clearly communicate the full set of information needed for a task.

This tip emphasizes providing all necessary context and avoiding implicit assumptions.
Example: Assumption-laden prompt: "Convert the temperature." Clear, detailed prompt: "Convert 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit. Use the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32. Round the result to two decimal places."

7. Think about the "theory of mind" of the model when writing prompts.
This involves considering how the AI might interpret instructions differently than a human would.

Example: Potential misinterpretation: "Draw a house." Clearer prompt: "Describe in words a simple drawing of a house, including details about its shape, windows, door, and roof."

8. Use version control and track experiments when working with prompts.
This tip suggests treating prompts like code, using tools to manage iterations and experiments.
Example: Version 1: "Summarize the text in 100 words." Version 2: "Summarize the text in 100 words, focusing on key events and main characters." Version 3: "Provide a 100-word summary of the text, highlighting the plot progression and character development."

9. Ask the model to identify unclear parts or ambiguities in your instructions.

This approach leverages the model's capabilities to improve your prompts.

Example: Prompt: "Explain quantum entanglement. Then, identify any parts of this instruction that could be made clearer or more specific."

10. Be precise without overcomplicating.
This balances the need for clarity with the importance of simplicity.
Example: Overcomplicated: "Utilizing your vast knowledge of culinary arts and nutritional science, construct a detailed, step-by-step methodology for the creation of a simple yet nutritious sandwich, taking into account dietary restrictions and flavor profiles." Precise and simple: "Provide a recipe for a healthy sandwich, including ingredients and preparation steps."


11. Consider the balance between typical cases and edge cases.

This tip reminds us to handle unusual scenarios without losing focus on the main use case.
Example: Balanced prompt: "Create a function to calculate the area of a circle. The function should handle positive real numbers for the radius and return 'Invalid input' for negative or non-numeric inputs."

12. Think about how prompts integrate into larger systems.

This involves considering broader context and system constraints.

Example: System-aware prompt: "Generate a product description in 50 words or less, optimized for mobile display, focusing on key features and benefits."

13. Don't rely solely on writing skills; prompt engineering requires a mix of clear communication and systematic thinking.
This tip highlights the multifaceted nature of prompt engineering, combining linguistic and logical skills.

Example: Systematic prompt: "1. Analyze the given text for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). 2. Identify the main topic. 3. List three key points. 4. Suggest a follow-up question based on the content."

14. When working with customers, help them understand the realities of user input.
This involves educating clients about real-world usage patterns and potential variations in user input.
Example: Customer education: "Let's consider how users might actually phrase their questions. Instead of 'What's the weather forecast?', they might type 'weather tmrw' or 'is it gonna rain'. How should our system handle these variations?"

15. Practice looking at data and model outputs extensively.

This tip encourages familiarizing yourself with how the model responds to different inputs through hands-on experience.
Example: Practice exercise: Analyze the outputs of the same prompt across different AI models or different versions of the same model, noting differences in style, content, and adherence to instructions.

Let’s attempt to understand several challenging questions that I will share with you how I used GPT-4 to to gain a firmer understanding of the question.  We will cover the following questions:





Is sensory grounding necessary for general intelligence?



How can we better understand the continuum of signs described by C.S.Peirce in semiotics?



How does evolutionary thinking relate to Alexander’s Nature of Order, and how can we use these ideas to understand other cognitive theories?



Can we lay the map for concepts that are beyond human comprehension?
