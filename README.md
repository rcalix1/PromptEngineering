* Here are them with examples:

1. Communicate clearly and precisely when writing prompts.

This tip emphasizes the importance of unambiguous language in prompts. Clarity reduces the chance of misinterpretation by the AI model.
Example: Unclear prompt: "Make it better." Clear prompt: "Revise the given text to improve grammar, clarity, and conciseness while maintaining the original meaning."

2. Be willing to iterate rapidly, sending many prompts to the model in quick succession.
This approach allows for quick refinement and improvement of results. It's about not being afraid to try multiple variations quickly.

Example: First attempt: "Write a poem about spring." Refinement: "Write a haiku about cherry blossoms in spring." Further refinement: "Write a haiku about cherry blossoms in spring, emphasizing their ephemeral nature."

3. Consider edge cases and unusual scenarios when designing prompts.
This tip encourages thinking beyond the typical use case to ensure robustness.
Example: Basic prompt: "Calculate the average of these numbers: 5, 10, 15." Edge case consideration: "Calculate the average of these numbers, handling any non-numeric inputs or empty sets: 5, 10, 15, apple, -20, []"

4. Test your prompts with imperfect, realistic user inputs.
This ensures your prompts can handle real-world scenarios where users might not provide perfect input.

Example: Ideal input: "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to French." Realistic input: "tranlate to french: hello how r u"

5. Read and analyze model outputs carefully.
This involves critically examining whether the model's response aligns with the intended outcome.
Example: Prompt: "List 5 capital cities in Europe." Output analysis: Check if all listed cities are indeed capital cities and located in Europe.
